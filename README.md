# Watch-todo

Most people just make To Do apps to learn React. How about you just watch me make a To Do app?

So far this just a YouTube-like scrubbable timeline + `time` state in my App react component.

To Do:
 - [ ] Finish UI for video playback
 - [ ] Get monaco editor working
 - [ ] Figure out how to store my real-time coding
